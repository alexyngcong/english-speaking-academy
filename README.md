# 🗣️ Speak Up — English Speaking Academy

A complete, friendly, **self-paced course** that takes you from **basic everyday English**
all the way to **confident, advanced speaking** — the kind tested in **IELTS, TOEFL &
Cambridge** speaking exams and needed in **job interviews** and **public speaking**.

Everything is taught in **British English** (Received-Pronunciation-style models,
British vocabulary and spelling), with a special focus on **tone, intonation and
sounding like a fluent native speaker**.

It runs **100% locally** in any web browser, works **offline**, and **remembers your
progress automatically**. No installation, no account, no server.

`index.html` is a **single self-contained file** — all the lessons, styling and logic
are bundled inside it. Copy that one file anywhere (USB stick, email, phone) and it just works.

## ▶️ How to start

1. Open **`index.html`** in your web browser (Chrome or Edge recommended — see below).
2. Start with **Speaking Foundations** and work top to bottom.
3. **Say every example out loud.** Tap 🔊 to hear a British voice, then copy it.

> 🎤 **For the full experience, use Chrome or Edge and allow microphone access.** That
> unlocks live **pronunciation scoring** (the app listens and tells you how close you
> were) and **recording** in the mock exams. In any other browser you can still listen
> to every model and practise aloud — only the mic features need Chrome/Edge.
